<html><body><p>I've gone back to creating a platform game in Unity. I started created a 2.5 platformer eariler this year. I would rather produce a high quality platformer than first person so I've been focusing on this. Here are some screenshots of the development and links to download builds (windows) and web (unity player needed). In 0.2 build I added a menu, that I'm quite happy with. I'll like to build 50 or so levels all completely different but still platformer.
I've added new scripts in order to make game play interested. Mostly camera movement and color change over time/mouse over. Had a go with collusions (would love item pickup/time/score display).

Anyway, I'm going to publish this.
