<html><body><p>Spent Thursday morning sitting in Startbucks working on a Unity scene. No internet connection so I was forced to work offline. No distructions.
To start I used Blender to model out some character features - a head, arm, and leg.



Here's some screenshots of the modeling in Blender:

And here it is taken into Unity:

I decided to work with a first person camera. Much of my work lately in Unity has been first person. It's Ludum Dare this weekend so I wanted to make sure I was warmed up. I'll likely work on something tonight, especially UI which scene lacks.



Anyway, Here's the game
