Couple of weeks ago I created Shark Nightmare for Shark Jam. It's uploaded on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brobeur.sharknightmare&amp;hl=en">Google Play</a> if you would like to download and play it.



The game is simple. It lasts for 6 minutes and during that time it switches between 3 different scenes. For the first two scenes - you can rotate the shark head around the screen by touch. In the third scene you are able to move freely, with the camera following you.



Here are screenshots and a summary post comp:

Black background. This gave a real since of emptiness. I used the same script that was used in Hell Earth in order to animated the textures. This gave a sense of movement in the scene. Several models that I created with relearning Maya were used as fillers for the environment. It's very minimal and a tighter and smaller environment may help.

This was scene two. You can see the girl character walking forward here. This is the same model that was used for Suburb Nightmare. One element I focused on with this project was shaders. I downloaded a TF Shader and appied it to my models. This gave a cartoonist, shiny look.

Opening scene. Had text scrolling up and down - black bars on top and bottom of the screen - to emulate a film type look. You are able to click and move the shark head around the scene.
