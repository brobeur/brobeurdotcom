<html><body><p>Triger is a game I made for #molyjam 2013. I used unity3d. 
Started with sketches first, before moving into 3d modeling and level design in unity. The process is much the same as when I made prodoIsland. This time I have more experience. I wanted the buttons to be important in telling a story, along with graphics and minecraft fonted quotes by Peter.

You can go fork the project on github. <a href="https://github.com/artctrl/Triger.git">Triger</a>.</p></body></html>
