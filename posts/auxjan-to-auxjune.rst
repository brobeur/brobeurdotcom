<html><body><p>I've opened a very old project. This dates back to January when i first started #1GAM. Since then my skills in Unity have developed greatly. 
There are a bunch of scenes - over 10 that I can merge together through buttons or checkpoints.

It's got first person controls for mouse and keyboard. I added first person mobile controls for mobile. Since this is a platformer much jumping is involved.

This didn't work well with the first person controls on mobile. Extremely awkward. Id like to explore this first person control further in future, but for now I decided to convert it to third person controls.

This makes it more of a traditional 3d platformer. Something I enjoy far more than 

One element ill like to add is a item pickup collusion. Maybe adding +1 to your score. Having an end point or goal. Perhaps enemies to avoid. Id like to keep it as non violent as I can

Other ideas would be add npc that give you quests/goals. 

If you would like to play the game here's the apk: <a href="http://brobeur.com/AUXjune.apk">AUXjune.apk</a>. The name is still the same as my last build, ill update the file name for next.

Feedback is greatly needed.</p></body></html>
