<strong>Description: </strong>In a surreal world with legs that never stop and monsters that keep coming, you have the ability to warp between planes, to continue in your quest to infinity while snacking on an amazing healing miracle known as bacon.



<strong>Help/Controls:</strong> Click to warp between darkness and color, to dodge the scary monsters. Things get faster as you progress, and the enemies become harder and harder to see across warps.

Our first thoughts were to make an adventure game where you have a ability to turn the lights off and on - items and environment changes. For example you can only see the burger at lights off, and only able to eat it with lights on. The game design went away from the adventure game and into a sidescroller runner where you turn off and on the lights in order to avoid the enemies. There is pick ups to restore your health along the way.



I spent the majority of the time just painting - many of the paintings were not used but I can always use them in other projects.



I also opened up Blender and created some 3d models. These models are rendered off as transparent pngs - this was my greatest achievement as I had been wanting to do this for sometime now. There are many aspects of this I am going to explore in future games.



Thanks :D
