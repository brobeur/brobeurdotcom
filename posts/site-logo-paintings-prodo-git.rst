What did I develop today?

Well this morning I woke up early and managed to get GIT working. That's right, GITs working with my Unity project. I've made three commits to it so far.

This is a new project - It was great to start fresh and import in assets I need, remove everything I don't. <a href="https://github.com/artctrl/AprilGame/commits?author=artctrl">Check out the project on Github</a>



Here's a few screenshots from Unity of the two scenes I made today.

I've also been busy today working logos for the site. This involved a little digital painting. My Intous5 tablet is currently broken so I've had to use my old one. Which isn't as good, but better than the mouse. Anyway, Here's the image:
