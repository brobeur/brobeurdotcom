<html><body><p>I've managed to make a successful Android build. You can <a href="http://www.brobeur.com/birdfice.apk">download the APK here</a>. Tested on my sisters Android phone. Really need a new android device. I think I'll go for a Samsung phone over a tablet. Smaller.


So far the game isn't much. I've used the bird model as character controller, and placed various 3d models around the level. Two lights are used and script added to them to change the intensity over time. This gives an interested effect.



Here's some screenshots:
