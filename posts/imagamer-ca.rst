<html><body><p>There is a game jam happening this weekend called <a href="http://www.iamagamer.ca">imagamer</a>. The theme is strong female protagonists. The main meetup is happening in Canada. I'm in New Zealand so just going to be doing it from home, and might stop by the library.


I've teamed up with Melanie. She's a 3d artist - so far she's drawn these concept characters:

Cute aren't they! It's always awesome to work with other people on games.



I've been playing around with RTS controls recently so wanted something similar for this game, decided to go with Diablo style - point and click controls, with the camera following. Make it mouse only so easy port it to Android.



Here's a screenshot:

Very basic scene, ground and cube. Got the camera to follow the player when the user clicks around.<a href="http://brobeur.com/imagamer/imagamer.html"> Here's a web build.</a>



I was a little early starting this jam, but I'll just keep track of time and finish early.</p></body></html>
