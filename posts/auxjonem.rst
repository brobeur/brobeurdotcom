<html><body><p>Spent the whole night mucking around in unity - focus was on camera/ui/lighting.
I opened a old scene in the project. It gave me a base to work from. 

Used the cube to create walls/floor/roof. Previously only planes had been used - and they are to skinny. 

Cubes are a little boring. In one of my 2.5d platformers I used a model for the floor. This looked more interesting than the cube. In future build ill explore using some of my 3d models.

I wanted this to fit with my other scene so recycled some objects - the red head portrait, player (though I added four smaller models behind the main character).

For the artwork I decided to import Catherines character paintings. I used one on these on the ui but reduced the alpha channel. 

I used her paintings to texture objects - especially that red. Looks damn good wrapped around

For the floor/wall/roof a small plain texture was used that I sniped from catherines character painting



My biggest achievment with this build is the text fade. 

One of my QA testers - Quentin asked me how to remove the ui in the last Catherine project. I had to tell him - you can't. 

I tried applying the text fade to the images but it didn't work. 



Having text fade out gives me lots of options

On the right side there is a series of her characters applied like paintings along the wall.

Left side I included some of my own paintings that were already part of the project.

The cameras interesting with the tilting but problems with the controls. 

There are points where you can't see player. Having the multi characters throws off the axies. I'll keep experimenting. In a previous 2.5d I used 10+ models and had them successfully running and jumping. A 2.5d control sceme may work better. Other option is to give the ability to switch between characters - a bit like real time stratagies but in a 3d platformer enviroment. Needs to have the ability for the four others to follow the main character.

One change i did to the other scene was add a orthographic camera.

It completely changed the look. Maybe add a button that could swich between the two views. 


 

 



 

 


Cycling through a range of lighting would also be good
