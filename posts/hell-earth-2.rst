<html><body><p>I'm about halfway though 7DFPS. My game is going great. Much of the focus has been on 3d modeling, animation, and texture painting. Getting fresh 3d models helps make a project feel very fresh. I then can take these models and apply to scenes - a cinematic adventure game emerged. Each scene lasts 60 seconds with various scenes allowing user input - by touch or click. Since this game was for a First Person Shooter game I wanted to use some elements of a FPS - so player is able to move player in first person mode by clicking. model then moves to where player clicked. The game is on a cycle, after the final scene the first scene loads. You could leave the game and you would continue to complete the game - there is no lose, only a lack of interaction and content. You are not punished.


The game can be played on the web at <a href="http://brobeur.com/hellearth.html">Hell Earth.</a>



It has also been submitted to the Google Play Store, keep an eye on<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=BroBeur+Studios"> this page </a>for it going live.



Anyway, here's some screenshots:
