I went for a great walk last night. I was feeling crap, but the walk helped. I decided to mod a Ludum Dare game - <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-26/?action=preview&amp;uid=36">Fishing Dream</a>.



It's great to explore others Unity projects - it gives ideas and a fresh perspective. There is always learning. Anyway, with the modding, I changed the colors of textures, added a (bad) skyline, changed fonts/colors, and added some of my 3d assets to the scene. The games general mechanics haven't changed.



You can download the game for windows <a href="http://www.BroBeur.com/FishingDream-windows.rar">here</a>, source code is on <a href="https://github.com/artctrl/BroBeurFishingDream">github</a>.



Changing the mechanics could be worth checking out - I'd like to add some timer elements to it - and platform elements. Knowing me, I won't do these and just move onto a new project and take what I've learnt from here to there.



Have a bunch of screenshots:
