<html><body><p>Unity Web Player Required. Windows/Mac/Linux builds soon with Android/iOS/Flash in future. 


PlayformFeb is a 3rd person platform adventure game where you control characters over a range of 5 different enviorments/game mechanics. The developer WMCKEE has used his digital paintings to texture the environment and characters. It has a minimal, cartoonist, outdated, but truly original look. Interesting use of lighting and game design. 



In many ways this is still a prototype for a game ill like to make in future. BroBeur Studios is glad to release <a href="http://freshfigure.com/brobeur/playform-feb-1.html">PlayformFeb v1 for Unity Web Player.</a>
