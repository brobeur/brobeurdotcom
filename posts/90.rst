<html><body><p>A tribute to classic RPG games. I first played no <em>Evoland</em><strong><em> when it created as part of the Ludlum dare compo. A retailer version is now released. Played played a pool of health over, stars. It's unlikely that I will finish, but I've played enough for a review and an discussion Evoland Classic is the original Ludlum dare #24 entry. I played a quick game of it test the differences Improvements are plentiful in the retail. Evoland consists of you moving right. Open a chest. Then left. Then all directions. From here graphics and other mechanics are improved, As you progress the game evolves. It is after all Evoland. Both turn based (typical system Japanese RPG games - like Final Fantasy) and real time (like Zelda and Diablo). Combat is quick - after playing final fantasy 3 where the time of entering and exiting combat takes forever? Needs a custom cartoonist font for the Typography. It pops up with multi kill and Unstoppable - but the basic Ariel font is not convincing. Some enviorments–. Especially as graphics improved felt somewhat empty – populated by minimal 3d assets. I felt there could more to add depth to scenes. Being able to zoom out (The Diablo like content). The lack of zoom may help</em></strong></p></body></html>
