<html><body><p>SO I've decided to create a new project. I was frustrated with the previous... I needed something fresh. There was many files in the previous project that weren't being used. I want to work with fewer objects and get something that works and looks sweet.

With this I have a 2d character movement (I'm using a 3d human model I made recently). This allows the character to walk back and forward from those pillars. I have a <a href="http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/268011/moving-platform.html">new moving cube script</a>. It's better than the last one I had, much more features.



Another 3d model was used - the curled shape. I placed this near the camera and attached a mouse look to it. This gives an interesting fps feel when moving up and down - the model rotates.  I've attached this to the blue cube, with the intent to create water. After all - I'm still doing the #GPCv17



In the background a painting has been used. This is a favorite of mine that I painted last year. The scene is in Wellington the waterfront.
