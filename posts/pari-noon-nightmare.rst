<html><body><p>Pari Noon Nightmare is the name of my game I'm creating for Indie Jolt Contest 10.


Spent the morning modeling in Maya - created several basic models - a balloon and a creature/character. I even have the character rigged - it's got a skeleton attached to the model and I can move it around with the joint tools. I've tried setting keys to create a walk cycle - but it doesn't seem to work. Opened Blender but it just errored on me! Really need to get my laptop fixed that has Linux Mint on it. Maya is great, but I think I'd prefer to stick with Blender - quicker and easier.



Here's the models up to now:

Balloon. Since the theme was party I needed to create some party related items. A balloon is a good start. I started with a cube and built out.  I find that much easier that starting with a circle object.



Next up, the creature:

This was spouse to be a lamp or street sign, but turned more into a creature. I think I'll have to create that sign with my next model!



Here's another couple of angle of the model:
