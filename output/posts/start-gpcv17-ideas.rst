<html><body><p>So I found out tonight that <a dir="ltr" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23GPCv17&amp;src=hash" data-query-source="hashtag_click"><s>#</s><b>GPCv17</b></a> is happening this week. Check out the website: http://www.gameprototypechallenge.com/


I've never done a challenge myself but I can give it a go this week. I've done several sketches so far. More needs to be done, but I'll like to get it into a game engine quickly. I'm going to take these drawings into blender and mash out some models. I'll then like to take my photography and texture and model with that. I may end up using digital paintings as well, but I'll like to get some textures made from photos first.
