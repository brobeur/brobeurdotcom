<html><body><p>Bioshock infinite is the third game in the Bioshock series. Released in march 2013 for playstation 3, xbox360 and Pc. This review covers the pc version of the game. 	this is the first game of the series that I've finished. I played the first a little - but my brother played it through and I watched. The first was certainly a classic. 	I never played the 2ND so unable to comment. Perhaps I should give it a go.</p></body></html>
