On Friday I went into my Mothers work and drew oil pastel drawings of sharks for - Shark Jam.

Shark Jam is a mini-LD. In the past I haven't had success with ludum dare. This one had to beÂ  different. 

On Saturday morning i was on my brothers windows desktop computer. At the start of a jam i also do some concept art - usually with pencil on paper - sometimes digital painting. 

Blender wasn't working so i decided to download Maya 2014 and give it a go. It's been years since I've used Maya - my skills i have taught myself in Blender are easily transferable. 

I shortcut extrude to e but this replaced rotate. Maya has the same controls as Unity3d for these shortcut keys. I survived, i had the most important key bound - extrude (along with move, rotate, and scale). 

Using concept art i modeled out a sharks head. This looked nothing like the art or even a shark! Still - it was a model and it was fresh. It will work.

I also modeled out shapes that could be used as fillers. Now that i had 3 or so models under my belt it was time to move onto unity.



I used a game I'm currently working on Suburb Nightmare 2 as a base - replacing assets and content with fresh, shark related content. 

Its always great to learn new techniques and skills. I've never looked at them in the past but this time i explored Shaders. I found a tf2 shader on the unity wiki that i used in the project. This gave a bright, shinny glow to the models. I also took the chance to watch videos on the programming language used with writing shaders. It's fun and easy to understand. In my next project ill like to explore writing my own shaders - likely with editing some preexisting. It will need to use the color i hold so dear.

What else? 

Several of my scripts have been improved - including the next level script, along with new scripts - flashing lights, color change over time. 

For music - i found a jaws theme on keyboard. I also used a tune from Emily - the girl who worked on redditgamejam with me. Her music is epic.

Shark Nightmare has 3 scenes each lasting 2 mins each. Cinematic adventure game.
