<html><body><p>Finished the game. Its name is suburb nightmare. It turned intoÂ  a 


adventure game. I sure learnt heaps on this project. One of the biggest achievements being finally getting to grip to using animation in unity. Expect to see more animation in future projects

I also created a bunch of new scripts, with one of the most useful being yield time delay. This is linked to loading of random scenes - but I could use it for anything. Again, a script I am going to continue using.

It was great working with a 3d artist. I only ended up modeling one model - the power pole. Melanie modeled everything else. I textured the car, and powerpole. She textured the characters. The houses didn't end up being textured. 



Found my tablet pen! I was able to use it for texturing. I have yet to do a digital painting, but plan on don't ng a bunch this week. 



Anyway, here's some screenshots of the game taken on my android phone - made sure the controls were mobile friendly.
