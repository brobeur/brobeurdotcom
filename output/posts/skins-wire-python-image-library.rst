<html><body><p>Lately I have been having fun with the PIL (Python Image Library). I have been developing a script that opens a bunch of random images from a folder, then edits them (merging mostly), and saves them to a new folders.
It is currently in two notebooks - the first (skins) opens up the files and saves them to an output folder. The second (wirePIL) opens up those images in the output folder, edits them again, and saves them.

I also have got text added to the images - I'm using 'A Film By William Mckee' for now, this could be changed to anything else (great for opening titles/credits).



Here's an example of what I've done with some screen caps from Cassies episode in Skins Season 6: <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/cas26822.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-594" alt="cas26822" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/cas26822.jpg" width="720" height="404"></a>
