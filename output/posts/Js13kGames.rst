Js13kGames is starting soon. It is a annual event that has happened since 2012. 
The jam runs for a month from 13:00 CEST, 13th August to 13:00 CEST, 13th September 2015. The theme will be announced at the start of the jam.

I don't think I'll enter this jam. The rules state the game must be written in javascript. Though I had ideas of writting something in Python 
that generates a HTML5 game. Perhaps a text based adventure game would be neat. I would also like to intergrate Twitter - something I have been
exploring recently with Python.

I just had a search for Python to Javascript. One result I got was pyjs. Maybe I could enter something...
