In this shot I added Catherines name to the left. Turned into credits.

Fixed UI in order to see more of the scene and triggers to move the tall blue and red character.

There is also buttons on the left and right for first person control. This scene isn't included in the APK file, but will be sure to include it in the next build - it's got the best game-play out of the collection of scenes.

Mixture of third and first person controls on mobile! Perfect.

This happened after a lot of changes and rearranging.

Firstly I added a text box and password box.

When you click these on the mobile device the keyboard appears. So easy.

Added the login button. This likely needs to be larger as it could be hard for some users to click. Currently this does nothing but I'll like to add the ability to login with WordPress account (could do heaps) of neat user interaction and customize with this ideas. Create my own database of players.

Anyway, currently it does nothing on the build. Next build I must make it do something - maybe save the username for the session and refer back to it. Give the game a personal touch.

Another thing I could quickly make since I've done this is a registration form.

This was the new second scene I worked on after getting sick of the first.

Idea behind this was to create a scene to select a team or faction. I had just been playing <em>Rift </em>so was inspired by the guardians and definers choice. <em>World Of Warcraft </em>had Alliance and Horde.

I decided to carry on the ideas of Bacon Game Jam and create, color vs gray scale. There is also the possibility of adding line. Perhaps as a third party or narration - neutral between color and gray scale.

I've established no real battle conflict between color and gray scale so no reason why they couldn't just work together and be friends.
