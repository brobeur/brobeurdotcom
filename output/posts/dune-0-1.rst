<html><body><p>So I've almost finished reading Dune. So close. Since I had been doing drawings from it I decided it might be cool to make a game based on it. I've been mucking around with this BirdCage and 24 inspired games. I've began merging them together somewhat. It's still early days but here's a <a href="http://brobeur.com/Brobeur-Dune-0-1-WINDOWS.rar">windows build</a> and a <a href="http://www.brobeur.com/Dune-0-1.html">web player version</a>. I recommend full screen for best experience. You can also see the <a href="https://github.com/artctrl/BirdCage">source on GitHub</a>, still named BirdCage.


What I need to do next:

</p><ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 12.986111640930176px;">Create 3d models of Dune characters/environments. </span></li>
	<li>New textures. I need to go though some of my older paintings and create textures from them</li>
	<li>Work on more scripts. I've been scripting more than focusing on art (though lighting and camera has been affected greatly from scripts</li>
</ul>

<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Have some screenshots:</span>

This week I'm going to take a break from this and start fresh with a <a href="http://jam.legendaryfisher.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=1">fishing game</a>. Join me in the Jam. I'll keep regular updates happening on here.
