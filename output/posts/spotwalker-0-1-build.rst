I've imported the assets that I created in Blender into Unity and created a basic, minimal scene. Added a first person camera. Some 3d assets rotate on mouse movement. Sound was added. I created<a href="http://brobeur.com/beat.wav"> this </a>sound by tapped on my computer, then another layer of clapped, and another of slapping my face. I'm not a music person, but at least I've created some sound for the game.



Here's some screenshots:
