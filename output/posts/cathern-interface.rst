<html><body><p>Hello. Awhile since an update. I've been using unity, focusing on the ui. 


Spent several days playing the game <em>Rift</em>. I've been 5 boxing in the game. Its been a long time. I use to dual box in <em>World Of Warcraft</em> - so great to give it a go in <em>Rift</em>. 

Playing an mmo sure gives me ideas on game development. Here's some screenshots of a project.

Importing 



I have been granted access to my friends cathern artwork. I have only ever used my own artwork in games so it feels very refreshing to work with others

I have an idea to work on an interface for aÂ  mmo RPG platform game. I've started developing the login screen, and will create a fraction selection screen etc.

Early ideas. Here I was experimenting with split screen and text. Layers are important to the UK. My last game lacked layers, making the ui feel empty and boring. I want to make a ui that is simple and sharp. The header ui in rift was too complex and was slow, I need something more simple.
