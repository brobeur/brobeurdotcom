Ludum Dare 33 is happening in a few weeks and I'm seriously considering giving it a go. This blog has been inactive since 2013 when it got hacked.
I didn't lose anything - just the frontpage went down. All the postss are saved along with the wp-contents page. The site is now a Nikola blog. 
The posts are a bit messed up but that's ok for now. 
I tend to write more code than make games but it's good for me to make a game now and then - just do something difference with my time. 
So yes, back to the subject of this post. LD33 is happening in a few weeks.

The tools I plan to use: 

Notebook and Pencil - I have a A6 visual diary that I have been using now and then. It doesn't get as much usage as it should though.
I should look into getting a new notebook and 2H pencil. 

GIMP - I will use my wacom tablet and GIMP for digital painting. The last time I had a go with digital painting was during KiwiJam15.

Blender - 3d modeling. I opened Blender the other night and created a basic character model and walk cycle. It was nothing impressive - 
but at least i know I still have it!.

Unity3d - I have a laptop with Windows7 on it. I don't use it much as my preference is Linux. I will install Unity3d and use it for the gamejam.
I will use the Fungus library. 

Thats all for now.
