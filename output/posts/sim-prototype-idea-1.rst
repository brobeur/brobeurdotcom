<html><body><p>You control two giant leaf arms and unleash evil onto the world. 
You have one min to destroy as many citizens as you can. Fire your layers. 

Blobs collect blobs and brings back to safe point.  These firewood will burn leaf after two minds.  Destroy them all.  

Citizens have random movement speed and look. 

Citizen unit types.  

Fast chatting banker.  This guy walks fast with that grin on that face. He's worried about losing value in relate that you so keenly want to destroy. 

Starving artist.  All that times spent life drawing were for nothing.  Was it something  she said? 

Concerned  mother. After all.  She wants a safe world for her children to grow up to.  

Play as both sides.   Do you play as that giant leaf,  city destroying plants issuing commands at it as you sit fit. 

Or the poor helpless citizens whom are scrapping for firewood. 

The choice is yours.</p></body></html>
