<html><body><p>In a weeks time 7dRTS is happening.  Here are some concept ideas for the game so far. I'll like to make a macro based game where you control a limited amount of character - I'm thinking 5, with a traditional mmo party setup - tank, healer, melee dps, ranged dps (hunter), and ranged magic dps. I'll like to focus on single player, and making something fun that merges together elements of RPG and RTS.


Anyway, here are the sketches so far.
