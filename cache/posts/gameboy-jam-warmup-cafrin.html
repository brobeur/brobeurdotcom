<p>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weekend &lt;a href=&quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.gbjam.net/">http://www.gbjam.net/</a>&quot;&gt;GBJAM&lt;/a&gt; is happening. This happens from July 5th - July 14th. I've been slack on the recent game jams (midsummer/1GAM crunch) and would really like to up my game and create something for this jam.
When I first found out about this jam happening (over a month ago now) I downloaded some gameboy roms for inspiration. I'm a big fan of platformers so that was my focus. I played titles such asSuper Mario Land, Kirbyâ€™s Dreamland. As a child with a gameboy color I enjoyed titles such a Pokemon Red. It makes sense for me to focus on a platformer type game.</p>
<p>The rules of the jam:</p>
<p>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The only official rule is the game must be GameBoy Themed&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>
<p>Easy enough, I enjoyed GameBoy games and can easily base my game around it. Combining elements from a range of GameBoy games is a goal for me.</p>
<p>&lt;blockquote&gt;Keep in the original GameBoy screen resolution of 160px x 144px&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>
<p>This is very small for me. I'm usually use to working with 1280x720 for mobile or 1920x1080 for desktop. Working small will be a great challenge.</p>
<p>&lt;blockquote&gt;Use only 4 colors in your game&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>
<p>Easy. I restrict my painting colors to a yellow, red, blue, and green.</p>
<p>To warmup for this jam I found a module for pygame called retrogamelib. This had examples out of the box that I opened up, replaced artwork and sounds (still some of the original sound there). I've been working though the code as well (creating my own levels). It will be easy enough to modify the levels py file in order to generate random levels. I'm not a big coder so I struggle to build full games from scratch (but it's something I need to practice more).</p>
<p>I used Catherine Shones artwork in this piece, the playable character is her with her child on her shoulders. Later on in the month is&lt;a href=&quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://iamagamer.ca/">http://iamagamer.ca/</a>&quot;&gt; iamagamer&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;- a focus on female protagonists, so this fits in nicely.</p>
<p>&lt;a href=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/gb1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-367&quot; alt=&quot;gb1&quot; src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/gb1.png&quot; width=&quot;486&quot; height=&quot;436&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Early build. Model had a feather effect that was later removed. Also added color to background</p>
<p>The background is a digital painting I did and the character is a watercolor painting by Cathern (heavy modifiyed in GIMP by me)</p>
<p>&lt;a href=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/gb2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-368&quot; alt=&quot;gb2&quot; src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/gb2.png&quot; width=&quot;481&quot; height=&quot;437&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Original models for enemies - I've only modified color.</p>
<p>&lt;a href=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/gb3.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-369&quot; alt=&quot;gb3&quot; src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/gb3.png&quot; width=&quot;491&quot; height=&quot;470&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Start screne. Painting by Catherine, modifited in GIMP by me</p>
<p>This was the same series of watercolor painting created by Catherine. I guess I should include the original:</p>
<p>&lt;a href=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/sharpened.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-370&quot; alt=&quot;sharpened&quot; src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/sharpened.jpg&quot; width=&quot;550&quot; height=&quot;1202&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p>
<p>A beautiful series of works.</p>
<p>Finally here's what the game looks like now:</p>
<p>&lt;a href=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/gb4.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-371&quot; alt=&quot;gb4&quot; src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/gb4.png&quot; width=&quot;488&quot; height=&quot;468&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/gb5.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-372&quot; alt=&quot;gb5&quot; src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/gb5.png&quot; width=&quot;488&quot; height=&quot;461&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p>
<p>I've fixed the character model - no more horrible feature effects, given the enemies a new model (again one of Catherines artworks modified by me.</p>
<p>And finally the download - &lt;a href=&quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://brobeur.com/cafrin.rar">http://brobeur.com/cafrin.rar</a>&quot;&gt;cafrin.rar&lt;/a&gt;</p>
<p>To run it you are going to need python and pygame, execute the file Cathern.py in the folder Cathern (sorry for switching names, terrible of me). You can do this in cmd/terminal by typing: python cathern.py</p>
<p>I'll work on getting a exe/apk version&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</p>
