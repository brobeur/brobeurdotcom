<p>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello.</p>
<p>There is currently a Fishing Jam happening. I was spose to start on time, but was held up.</p>
<p>But I've gotten stuck into it now - creating levels within Unity.</p>
<p>Here's something I wrote on the Fishing Jam forum:</p>
<p>For this Fishing Jam I'm going to be making a game called 'Black Cat Fishing Extreme' in Unity3d. I'm a little behind in starting, but had family visit from overseas. I'm looking forward at spending the next 6 days working on this fishing game. I plan on producing a product that will be both desktop and mobile friendly. like the 7 day jam format over 48 hours as it gives more time to develop.</p>
<p>Lately I've been working on First Person and Third Person Platform Adventure games. I'll like to keep developing these ideas for the fishing Jam. Focus is on lighting, color, camera, time, and experimental mechanics.</p>
<p>I started this project how I start them all - with a pencil and paper. This time the pencil was in fact a marker pen. Using a large a3 visual diary I sketched out ideas. These were mostly of cats. My Mother has a Cat - Black Cat his name is. He's very special. He needs a game about him. During this game Black Cat can go fishing - because he loves fish and sometimes i think he gets sick of Science Diet and would like fish. As you explore the world of Black Cat Fishing Extreme the amount of fish caught increases.</p>
<p>I'm aiming for 5 unique areas - polished with a mixture of third and first person adventure platform elements.</p>
<p>The first area I've been working on. Many of these elements and models have been recycled from previous projects. First person controller added with the color fishing rod, human, light, and spike shape attached to camera. This creates an interesting UI/first person camera.</p>
<p>I want to increase the player interactivity so added additional aspects to first person controller - Using 'C' the player crouches. This creates a springy effect on the UI objects as well. I have another script that doesnt effect the UI - maybe I'll include both. The more mechanics the better - just have to incorporate them simple.</p>
