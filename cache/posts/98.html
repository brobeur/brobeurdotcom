<p>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today was spent in Wellington but I did wakeup at 4 and work on scenes.&nbsp; I had the art assets that I modelled last night - it was just about creating a composition and adding new script (which didn't really happen).
The player model was from a previous project so was quick to replace it with the player model that I had&nbsp; modelled in blender.</p>
<p>I created a total of 4 scenes - all third person, fixed camera,&nbsp; where the player can walk left,&nbsp; and right.</p>
<p>I have a moving cube script&nbsp; that I use regularly.&nbsp; I attached this script to the blue cube. With the right angle it looks like water drifting in and out.&nbsp; Perfect,&nbsp; I've created an island.</p>
<p>I worked on the ui as well. I have&nbsp; a script that I use for buttons.&nbsp; Currently they are set to level zero,&nbsp; one,&nbsp; two,&nbsp; three etc.&nbsp; I'll like to rework these and instead include them on the main title scene.&nbsp; An idea is to call them different parts of Pronto Island.&nbsp; This adds story and depth to the world.</p>
<p>Today I've spent the day in Wellington,&nbsp; walking and drawing mostly.&nbsp; The three drawings I did are going to be used as concept art pieces in Pronto Island.&nbsp; I'm excited to arriving home and working on new assets.</p>
<p>I'm happy with&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</p>
