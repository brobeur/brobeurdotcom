<p>Couple of weeks ago I created Shark Nightmare for Shark Jam. It's uploaded on &lt;a href=&quot;<a class="reference external" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brobeur.sharknightmare&amp;amp;hl=en">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brobeur.sharknightmare&amp;amp;hl=en</a>&quot;&gt;Google Play&lt;/a&gt; if you would like to download and play it.</p>
<p>The game is simple. It lasts for 6 minutes and during that time it switches between 3 different scenes. For the first two scenes - you can rotate the shark head around the screen by touch. In the third scene you are able to move freely, with the camera following you.</p>
<p>Here are screenshots and a summary post comp:</p>
<p>&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-504&quot; alt=&quot;shark5&quot; src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/shark5-1024x638.png&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;638&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>Black background. This gave a real since of emptiness. I used the same script that was used in Hell Earth in order to animated the textures. This gave a sense of movement in the scene. Several models that I created with relearning Maya were used as fillers for the environment. It's very minimal and a tighter and smaller environment may help.</p>

<p>This was scene two. You can see the girl character walking forward here. This is the same model that was used for Suburb Nightmare. One element I focused on with this project was shaders. I downloaded a TF Shader and appied it to my models. This gave a cartoonist, shiny look.</p>

<p>Opening scene. Had text scrolling up and down - black bars on top and bottom of the screen - to emulate a film type look. You are able to click and move the shark head around the scene.</p>
