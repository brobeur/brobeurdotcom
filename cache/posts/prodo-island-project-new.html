<p>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;SO I've decided to create a new project. I was frustrated with the previous... I needed something fresh. There was many files in the previous project that weren't being used. I want to work with fewer objects and get something that works and looks sweet.
&lt;a href=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Capture9.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-134&quot; alt=&quot;Capture9&quot; src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Capture9-300x141.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;141&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p>
<p>With this I have a 2d character movement (I'm using a 3d human model I made recently). This allows the character to walk back and forward from those pillars. I have a &lt;a href=&quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/268011/moving-platform.html">http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/268011/moving-platform.html</a>&quot;&gt;new moving cube script&lt;/a&gt;. It's better than the last one I had, much more features.</p>
<p>Another 3d model was used - the curled shape. I placed this near the camera and attached a mouse look to it. This gives an interesting fps feel when moving up and down - the model rotates. &nbsp;I've attached this to the blue cube, with the intent to create water. After all - I'm still doing the #GPCv17</p>
<p>In the background a painting has been used. This is a favorite of mine that I painted last year. The scene is in Wellington the waterfront.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</p>
