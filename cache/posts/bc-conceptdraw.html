<p>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a beautiful day today so went for a walk and drew. This weekend 7hFPS is happening. People are encouraged to make a First Person Shooter game in 7 hours. 7 hours isn't long, but you can get a basic prototype for a game happening - and then maybe extend it when 7dFPS happens - next weekend.
For this I'm going to continue extending the idea of touch to move a third person object - how could I do this well still making a first person shooter.</p>
<p>You are the bullet. You are in first person, but the player controls the bullet. You are the bullet. This is my idea for 7hFPS and I'll like to extend it further for 7dFPS. I'll like to keep exploring the idea of timed scenes - maybe in a more structured way.</p>
<p>Anyway here's the drawings I did today for 7hFPS:</p>

Title: Bullet Control</p>

<p>I have yet to make anything in Unity, and it's getting late. Too much time messing around on the internet doing nothing and not working on the game. Teaching a class at 1pm tomorrow so have to get a semi-early sleep. Planning on having everything ready tonight and sleep in tomorrow.</p>
<p>Now to open Unity...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</p>
