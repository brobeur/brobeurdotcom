<p>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've opened a very old project. This dates back to January when i first started #1GAM. Since then my skills in Unity have developed greatly.
There are a bunch of scenes - over 10 that I can merge together through buttons or checkpoints.</p>
<p>It's got first person controls for mouse and keyboard. I added first person mobile controls for mobile. Since this is a platformer much jumping is involved.</p>

<p>II</p>
<p>This didn't work well with the first person controls on mobile. Extremely awkward. Id like to explore this first person control further in future, but for now I decided to convert it to third person controls.</p>

<p>This makes it more of a traditional 3d platformer. Something I enjoy far more than</p>
<p>One element ill like to add is a item pickup collusion. Maybe adding +1 to your score. Having an end point or goal. Perhaps enemies to avoid. Id like to keep it as non violent as I can</p>
<p>Other ideas would be add npc that give you quests/goals.</p>
<p>If you would like to play the game here's the apk: &lt;a href=&quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://brobeur.com/AUXjune.apk">http://brobeur.com/AUXjune.apk</a>&quot;&gt;AUXjune.apk&lt;/a&gt;. The name is still the same as my last build, ill update the file name for next.</p>
<p>Feedback is greatly needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</p>
