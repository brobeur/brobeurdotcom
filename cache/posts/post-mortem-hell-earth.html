<p>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven day first person shooter is over for 2013. Some top notch games were made. See what I did there?!
BroBeur Studios released a cinematic adventure game, that had elements of first person without the shooter.</p>
<p>The game was developed from the previous weekends effort -&nbsp; 7hfps.</p>
<p>One of the major changes was the use of a animated texture script. This was used in both environment and characters.</p>
<p>The possibilities with this script are endless. For future projects spite sheets will be created for characters and backgrounds. During this project the script was applies to just normal textures. Still it gave an interesting movement and depth to the project.</p>
<p>Another element that was improved upon was loading the next scene. The game has a bunch of scripts to load the next scene every 60 seconds. I'd like to improve on this as 10 scripts all doing the same thing is bad.</p>
<p>Intergrating the camera switch that was used on SuburbNightmare could also add interest. Perhaps on user touch? Would work well for scene that had no character controller.</p>
<p>Find the game over at 7dFPS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</p>
