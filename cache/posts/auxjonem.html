<p>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spent the whole night mucking around in unity - focus was on camera/ui/lighting.
I opened a old scene in the project. It gave me a base to work from.</p>
<p>Used the cube to create walls/floor/roof. Previously only planes had been used - and they are to skinny.</p>
<p>Cubes are a little boring. In one of my 2.5d platformers I used a model for the floor. This looked more interesting than the cube. In future build ill explore using some of my 3d models.</p>

<p>I wanted this to fit with my other scene so recycled some objects - the red head portrait, player (though I added four smaller models behind the main character).</p>
<p>For the artwork I decided to import Catherines character paintings. I used one on these on the ui but reduced the alpha channel.</p>
<p>I used her paintings to texture objects - especially that red. Looks damn good wrapped around</p>
<p>For the floor/wall/roof a small plain texture was used that I sniped from catherines character painting</p>
<p>My biggest achievment with this build is the text fade.</p>
<p>One of my QA testers - Quentin asked me how to remove the ui in the last Catherine project. I had to tell him - you can't.</p>
<p>I tried applying the text fade to the images but it didn't work.</p>
<p>Having text fade out gives me lots of options</p>
<p>On the right side there is a series of her characters applied like paintings along the wall.</p>
<p>Left side I included some of my own paintings that were already part of the project.</p>

<p>The cameras interesting with the tilting but problems with the controls.</p>
<p>There are points where you can't see player. Having the multi characters throws off the axies. I'll keep experimenting. In a previous 2.5d I used 10+ models and had them successfully running and jumping. A 2.5d control sceme may work better. Other option is to give the ability to switch between characters - a bit like real time stratagies but in a 3d platformer enviroment. Needs to have the ability for the four others to follow the main character.</p>

<p>One change i did to the other scene was add a orthographic camera.</p>

<p>It completely changed the look. Maybe add a button that could swich between the two views.</p>
<p>Cycling through a range of lighting would also be good</p>
