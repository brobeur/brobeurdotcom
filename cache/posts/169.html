<p>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;SO currently working in Notepad++ on an HTML5 game. I've drawn up a tiny screen - and filled with rectangles. I was aiming to make a scene similar to my digitail paintings - red for the hills. yellow people. green floor. Lets see how it goes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</p>
