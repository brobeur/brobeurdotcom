<p>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello. My name is William Mckee. I attended The Learning Connexion from July 2010 till November 2012. I finished with a diploma with honors.
My focus was drawing with a little painting on the side. I also developed a strong interest (obsession?) for computer programming also</p>
<p>My language of choice was Python. Traveling on the Tlc bus from Newtown to Taita and return gave me time to code.</p>
<p>Life drawing was a buzz. It was really one of the only types of classes i would attend. Dans monday, rogers monday (when he had a model), and dans friday (every 2nd week) were my favorite mains to attend. I also appreachied techniques that i learnt from gary freemantle and roger key.</p>
<p>For life drawing i often worked landscape on brown paper or visual diary. Working large is easier than small.</p>
<p>Medium of choice was pencil, colored pencil, oil pastel, and acrylic paint.</p>
<p>Block Weeks meant Robert Franklen, Christena Earl, and Roger Key. Sometimes i would jump between classes for a model.</p>
<p>I often attended life drawing classes outside of tlc - dr sketchy wellington, vincents, and local life drawing classes around the country. I was a goal of mine to travel the world and draw models whereever i go.</p>
<p>My time outside&nbsp; of tlc was spent blogging about life drawing. My aim was 300 words a day but would often reach lengths of 2000 words. My grammar and writing skills inceased.</p>
<p>I was an onsite student till July 2011. Extramural worked well for me as i was able to focus on life drawing classes and then have days off to explore wellington, and travel.</p>
<p>I became more and more tired of drawing the human body and focused more on enviroment works - working from life and drawing streets, waterfronts, and anything that was in front of me.</p>
<p>On days off from life drawing i focused on 3d modeling. Before attending tlc i had been trained with Maya. This time i decided on using Blender. I began taking my enviorment drawings inside of blender and creating worlds. I began creating small&nbsp; animated shorts and uploading them to YouTube.</p>
<p>As time went on i needed to&nbsp; learn another program. Unity3d, a very popular 3d game engine that enables you to create builds for cross platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</p>
