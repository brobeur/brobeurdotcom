<p>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday I decided to take a bus to Auckland. it had been several months since I had been. the main reason for traveling there was A meet up for Auckland game developers. I first attended this meet up in Auckland was January 2013. this was a huge inspiration to create games for the next several months.
I've meet some great people over the year here including Erik, Hayden, Blake, and dozens of chats with like minded individuals.</p>
<p>pizza and drinks are served each month after the talk. its the social aspect is most enjoyable.</p>
<p>I try to talk to as many people as I can - especially those I haven't talked to before.</p>
<p>This time I talked to several people who worked (or had worked) at GameLoft.</p>
<p>GameLoft are hiring a bunch of people currently so it was great to chat to them in order to help my cover letter.</p>
<p>In other news -GameJolt contest 10 is happening this week. The theme is party</p>
<p>Are you going to join?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</p>
