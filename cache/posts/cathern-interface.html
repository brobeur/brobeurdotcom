<p>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello. Awhile since an update. I've been using unity, focusing on the ui.</p>
<p>Spent several days playing the game &lt;em&gt;Rift&lt;/em&gt;. I've been 5 boxing in the game. Its been a long time. I use to dual box in &lt;em&gt;World Of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; - so great to give it a go in &lt;em&gt;Rift&lt;/em&gt;.</p>
<p>Playing an mmo sure gives me ideas on game development. Here's some screenshots of a project.</p>

<p>Importing</p>
<p>I have been granted access to my friends cathern artwork. I have only ever used my own artwork in games so it feels very refreshing to work with others</p>
<p>I have an idea to work on an interface for a&nbsp; mmo RPG platform game. I've started developing the login screen, and will create a fraction selection screen etc.</p>

<p>Early ideas. Here I was experimenting with split screen and text. Layers are important to the UK. My last game lacked layers, making the ui feel empty and boring. I want to make a ui that is simple and sharp. The header ui in rift was too complex and was slow, I need something more simple.</p>

<p>Added text over the portrait images. The font is impact - popular with memes. New font used for&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</p>
