<p>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artistic, Inovative, Creative, Ideas outside the box.</p>
<p>Experienced at years of video game. Sega, Pacman, Playstation.</p>
<p>Focus always has been on third person.</p>
<p>Currently working on Video Games in Unity3d. Several projects are in production. I'm not sure where they will go, they merge and change all the time. In the end it will be just one game. But that may change.</p>
<p>Drawing has been a passion for years. I've always wanted to draw. Just everyday. Over the years my drawing has gotten tighter and more realistic. Although I still possive a very abstract and expressive nature - especially my painting layers.</p>
<p>I work in GIMPmostly. With my Wacom Intous Tablet (which is currently broken, but getting fixed) I apply a red line, then a grayscale tonal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</p>
