<p>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unity Web Player Required. Windows/Mac/Linux builds soon with Android/iOS/Flash in future.</p>
<p>PlayformFeb is a 3rd person platform adventure game where you control characters over a range of 5 different enviorments/game mechanics. The developer WMCKEE has used his digital paintings to texture the environment and characters. It has a minimal, cartoonist, outdated, but truly original look. Interesting use of lighting and game design.</p>
<p>In many ways this is still a prototype for a game ill like to make in future. BroBeur Studios is glad to release &lt;a href=&quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://freshfigure.com/brobeur/playform-feb-1.html">http://freshfigure.com/brobeur/playform-feb-1.html</a>&quot;&gt;PlayformFeb v1 for Unity Web Player.&lt;/a&gt;</p>
<p>Feedback greatly needed. Please email <a class="reference external" href="mailto:enquires&#64;brobeur">enquires&#64;brobeur</a>.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</p>
