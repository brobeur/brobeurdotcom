<p>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Triger is a game I made for #molyjam 2013. I used unity3d.
Started with sketches first, before moving into 3d modeling and level design in unity. The process is much the same as when I made prodoIsland. This time I have more experience. I wanted the buttons to be important in telling a story, along with graphics and minecraft fonted quotes by Peter.</p>
<p>You can go fork the project on github. &lt;a href=&quot;<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/artctrl/Triger.git">https://github.com/artctrl/Triger.git</a>&quot;&gt;Triger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</p>
